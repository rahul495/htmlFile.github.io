        <p style="color:red;font-size:18px;"> The next major release of the JDK and therefore of the Java API will be 1.1, with a prerelease version available sometime in the later part of 1996. This release will have few changes to the language, but a number of 
additional capabilities and features added to the class library. Throughout this book, if a feature will change or will be enhanced in 1.1, we'll let you know, and in the last two days of this book you'll find out more about 
new Java features for 1.1 and for the future.
